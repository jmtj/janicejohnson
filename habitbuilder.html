        <p>An app to give health-conscious individuals the ability to manage and improve their health and wellness habits in a centralized location and to enable them to create an accountability network by giving them the ability to share their

      <div><!-- Assumptions & Hypothesis paragraph START -->
        <p>Based on the project objective, I established assumptions that there is a need and desire for users to have a customizable habit tracking application that allows them to create their own accountability network.</p>
        <p>I then derived hypotheses of how the app would meet their needs and desires to make users successful in their wellness journeys.</p>
        <p>The assumptions and hypotheses drove the direction of my competitive analysis and user research.</p>

      <div><!-- Competitive Analysis paragraph START -->
        <p>The initial competitive analysis was with two apps that offer similar habit tracking options independent of the user’s tracking device, Metriport and HabitShare. Metriport has more features but does not offer sharing with a social
          network. HabitShare has a social network sharing function, but it is a simpler app with less features and no integrations with tracking devices.</p>
        <p>Additional apps were researched throughout the process as new discoveries were made during user research, wireframing, prototyping and testing. These included but not limited to, My Fitness Pal, Habitify, and HabitNow.</p>

          <p>The most prevalent risk is the number of other health and wellness apps available to the target audience. This makes it challenging to acquire market share with all the other noise from other apps and to gain ranking in searches for
            health and wellness apps. Many users are tied to the apps of their wearable trackable devices, but that limits them to only connections with the same brand of wearable.</p>
          <p>There is potential to develop a competitive health and wellness app that</p>
          <ul>
            <li>does not limit users to the device they wear</li>
            <li>allows integration with their wearables for auto-load of their fitness activity metrics</li>

        <p>Starting with mid-fidelity prototypes, usability tests were conducted with 6 participants who met the target audience criteria. The testing provided insight to where the design was lacking intuitiveness, consistency, and unnecessary
          distractions.
        <p>To analyze the results, I used affinity mapping and a rainbow spreadsheet process to group and prioritize the findings.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Using Gestalt Laws and Google’s Material Design Guidelines, I created the High-Fidelity prototype ensuring I established hierarchies, emphasis, and groupings of similarities.</p>
        <p>I applied grids and margins to ensure good balance and visual organization to my screens.</p>
        <p>I applied Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which resulted in more accessible form fields and better color contrast for the app.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Account management and user preferences have not been fully designed and are critical for the usability and functionality of the application for the users, making them the next priority of design.</p>
        <p>The design to this point has focused on fundamental functionality, but during the usability testing and peer collaboration, progress visualizations were identified as desired features to help users see their goal progress.</p>
        <p>Visualizations were in the long-term design plan and will be made the next priority in design and protype development after account management and preferences.</p>
        <p>Another planned feature of the application to help encourage engagement and accountability, is the ability to connect with users' physical trainers to receive workouts from their trainers and for trainers to see their clients’ progress.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the standards that have been established for the entire application, these features will have the same usability testing and peer collaboration the existing prototype has undergone to ensure we are creating the desired
          experience for the users.</p>
        <p>Additionally, A/B preference testing will be utilized to get feedback from real potential users of the application.</p>
        <p>We will know the design is desirable and the implementation effective when I see how many users are using the tool consistently, how many users share the app with their friends, how many users connect with their physical trainers via the
          app, and how many users are meeting the goals that they set for themselves.</p>
